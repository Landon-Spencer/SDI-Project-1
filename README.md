# SDI-Project-1
## Problem Statement
This apps will help you find art from the Met Museum by different art styles and present information about the artist and the work of art if it is available.
## How to Download the Project
Clone the project onto your machine by using the commands below for HTTPS, or SSH and entering it in the command line from the folder where you want the project saved.<br>
> HTTPS - `git clone https://github.com/Landon-Spencer/SDI-Project-1.git`<br>
> SSH - `git clone git@github.com:Landon-Spencer/SDI-Project-1.git`
## How to Run the Project
After you have a cloned folder with the project files run `open index.html` in the SDI-Project-1 folder. This should open a local version in your default browser.
## How to use the App
Now that you have a web page showing you can choose one of the art style options in the top right select bar. After you select an option you can search the Metropolitan Museum API for that art style. The search will display the first item that it finds and you can use the arrows to search through all of the options that are returned.
## Wireframe layout
Below is my original wireframe layout built on Figma.

After creating the basic layout I decided to use more natural tones for color.
