## Problem Statement
This apps will help you find art from the Met Museum by different art styles and present information about the artist and the work of art if it is available. The user can also keep a stored list of favorite art pieces and view them on a separate page.
## How to Download the Project
Clone the project onto your machine by using the commands below for HTTPS, or SSH and entering it in the command line from the folder where you want the project saved.<br>
> HTTPS - `% git clone https://github.com/Landon-Spencer/SDI-Project-1.git`<br>
> SSH - `% git clone git@github.com:Landon-Spencer/SDI-Project-1.git`
## How to Run the Project
After you have a cloned folder with the project files run `open index.html` in the SDI-Project-1 folder. This should open a local version in your default browser. This app works best in chrome, so if chrome isn't your default browser you can copy the URL from you default browser to a chrome browser for a better experience.
## How to use the App
### Search Function
Now that you have a web page showing you can choose one of the art style options in the top right select bar. After you select an option you can search the Metropolitan Museum API for that art style. The search will display the first item that it finds and you can use the arrows to search through all of the options that are returned. Due to copyright some of the artist may not have a display image, but their info can still be viewed at the bottom.
### Favorites Function
Once you find an art piece that you like you an add it to your favorites list. To do this you click on the **Add to Favorites** button below the image. An alert will display confirming that the art piece has been added. The artist info will then be stored in local storage so that it can be viewed later. To view your favorites navigate to the **Favorites** page in the top right of the page and it will display your first favorite image. You can then scroll through all of your favorites by using the arrows. If you want to remove an art piece by clicking on the **Remove from Favorites** button below the image. An alert will confirm that the art piece has been removed and the favorites page will update automatically.
## Wireframe layout
Below is my original wireframe layout built on Figma.

After creating the basic layout I decided to use more natural tones for color.
